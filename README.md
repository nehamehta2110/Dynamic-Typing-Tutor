In this project, we propose Dynamic Typing Tutor, an individual tutoring system for text entry that detects input stumbles and provides instructions. By conducting our study, we clarify common typing errors and most predicted typing style. Based on the study, we implement a Typing Tutor that will support learning text entry with accuracy and speed.
This project includes a simple implementation of the word predictor algorithm and typing error correction algorithm. So, accordingly, we will design a Typing Tutor that automatically detects input stumbles and provides instructions that help users to resolve input stumbles independently. 
We define the word “input stumble” as an occasion when a user makes a mistake or does not know what/how to type next. We will then help the user to choose the next word with our tutor. 
The different tasks performed by the dynamic typing tutor are:- 

	Error Correction
	Word Prediction
	User Profiling <img src="https://github.com/nehamehta2110/Dynamic-Typing-Tutor/blob/master/Dynamic%20Typing%20Tutor/gif2.gif" width=50 height=30/>
